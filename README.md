Vegas Holo Contacts Theme
======================

This template will theme the secret messaging app's contact list. You can set any default wallpaper, the background for the contact item, the selector for the snippet text, the selector for the overflow button, and the graphical resource for the text and call ImageButtons.

To modify this theme all you have to do is:

1: Change the package name in the manifest to anything else.

2: Change the meta-data value with name "vegas_contacts_theme". Keep the name unchanged, and change the value to whatever you'd like to name the theme.

3: The key drawables are contact_background, overflow_background, and snippet_background. They are selectors, and you can change them any way you'd like.

4: You can specify a custom default wallpaper by including a graphic named vegas_contacts_wallpaper in any density bucket. It's recommended to use reasonable resolution, ie. xxhdpi is 1080 and xhdpi is 720.
